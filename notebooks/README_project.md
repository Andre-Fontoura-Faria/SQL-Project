PROJECT 
This project compares the best bootcamps in Data Analytics by analyzing data from SwitchUp. Our team has cleaned and filtered the data to understand the ranking online, with a focus on Ironhack.

Methodology
We started by checking the mean score, job support, and curriculum for all the schools to understand the ranking. We found that the number of reviews was very important to climb into the rank.

Next, we tried to understand the reasons behind the scores by analyzing the sentiment score of the comments.

Finally, we drew conclusions based on our analysis and explained them in this README file.



ERD
The ERD for this project is not applicable since we did not use a database (we extracted the data from the SwitchUp Website).
